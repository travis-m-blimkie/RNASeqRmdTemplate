# RNASeqRmdTemplate
This repository is designed to hold a custom RMarkdown template, suited for the
typical RNA-Seq analysis performed as my work at UBC.

Here's a [link](https://github.com/travis-m-blimkie/RNASeqRmdTemplate/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/RNASeqRmd_v1/skeleton/skeleton.Rmd)
directly to the Rmd template.
